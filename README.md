# covid19
In this final project, we will investigate the spread of COVID-19 in the United States from January of 2020. We hope to answer the following two questions: does the spread of COVID-19 display different trends across various regions of the United States? How can we forecast the epidemiological outbreak of COVID‚Äê19 within the United States by predicting the number of confirmed cases using regression techniques? Through this project, we hope to demonstrate our abilities to work with data at different levels of granularities, identify the type of data collected (including missing values, anomalies, etc), and explore characteristics and distributions of individual variables through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and provide multiple visualizations to model our given data. We will be using scikit-learn as a tool for our predictive analysis, and we will aim to create a simple Linear Regression model to be able to forecast the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases for the near future.
